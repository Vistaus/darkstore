## Building from source

The recommended method is to use KPackage Manager:

1. Install the package that provides the `kpackagetool6` command in your distribution.
2. Clone `https://github.com/vmkspv/darkstore.git` repository and `cd darkstore`.
3. Run `kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Applet --install package` command.

After installation, the applet should appear in the standard panel as part of the System Tray widget.

To update an existing installation, use `--upgrade` instead of `--install`.
